# Jazz Questionnaire App

## Description

The idea of application is to measure the probability that the person who complete the quiz could be a jazzman.  
This is my first personal project with use of React.js:
- concept of project
- layout and style of page
- logic of application
- code

 *Jazz Questionnaire* is focused on React's main concepts like **Hooks, Forms, Components(and comunication between them), Props, JSX and others.**

Technologies I used in project:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- RWD
- BEM methodology

## Requirements
